1.Basic Calculator-WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

This project is a simple web-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator's functionality is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The HTML structure of the calculator includes a text input field (with the id 'display') where users can see and input arithmetic expressions, and a set of buttons for various numerical digits, operators, and control actions. The available buttons include digits from 0 to 9, operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as special buttons for clearing the input ('AC'), calculating the result ('='), parentheses, percentage, and a decimal point.
The JavaScript code interacts with the HTML elements to provide the calculator's functionality. 
The key features of the calculator include:
1)Input Handling: The calculator handles user input through button clicks. When a digit button is clicked, the corresponding digit is appended to the input field. Operators and special buttons update the expression accordingly.
2)Clearing: The 'AC' button clears the input field.
3)Calculation: When the '=' button is clicked, the total() function is called. This function evaluates the expression using the eval() function and displays the result in the input field. If an error occurs during evaluation, the field displays 'Error'.
4)Event Listeners: Event listeners are attached to each button using JavaScript. These listeners detect button clicks and trigger appropriate functions based on the button's text content.
5)Styling: The CSS stylesheet ('css.css') is linked to the HTML file to provide a visually appealing design to the calculator interface.


2.TRIBUTE PAGE-WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
This project is a tribute webpage dedicated to the renowned Indian scientist and former President, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The webpage is designed using HTML and styled with CSS to present a comprehensive overview of his life, achievements, and contributions to various fields.
This tribute webpage aims to honor the legacy of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam by presenting a detailed account of his life, accomplishments, and contributions. It employs an organized and structured layout to convey information effectively. The use of images, quotes, and sections adds to the visual and textual richness of the webpage.


3.TO DO LIST-WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
It is an HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript code for a To-Do List application. The provided code combines these components to create a functional and visually appealing To-Do List page. The page consists of a title section introducing the purpose of the To-Do List, a navigation header to switch between active and completed tasks, a container to display tasks, buttons for adding tasks and clearing completed tasks, and a template for each task item.
The JavaScript code includes functionality to add, update, delete, and sort tasks, as well as manage the visibility of different sections and buttons based on user actions. It also interacts with local storage to store and retrieve tasks persistently.


4.LOGIN FORM AUTHENTICATION-WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
This project involves the creation of a user authentication system through a login and signup form. The form's purpose is to allow users to either log in to an existing account or create a new account. The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly, using the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts and a clean layout.

Key Features:
1)Toggle between Login and Signup: Users can switch between the login and signup forms by clicking on the "Signup" or "Login" links, which triggers a smooth transition between the two forms.
2)Password Visibility Toggle: The "eye" icon allows users to toggle password visibility, showing or hiding the password characters while typing.
3)Form Validation: The signup form includes a basic password length validation, alerting users if their chosen password is not at least 8 characters long.
4)Stylish Design: The design employs a modern and clean aesthetic with a color scheme that blends well with the form's purpose.
5)Redirect after Submission: After successful submission of the forms, users are redirected to a hypothetical "pickAbook.html" page. In a real application, this redirection could be used to authenticate and authorize users, granting access to protected areas of the website.

Overall, this project focuses on the frontend aspect of user authentication. For a complete solution, you would typically need to connect the frontend to a backend server for processing user data securely, handling sessions, and managing user accounts.
